# **Weather App üîÜ**

The Weather App is a responsive React-based application that allows users to view real-time weather information for any city. Users can search for weather by city name or use their current location to get the latest weather updates. The app provides detailed weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition description, along with a 5-day weather forecast.

The app uses data from a weather API, and users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for temperature display. The user interface is designed with Bootstrap and custom SCSS for a clean and modern appearance.
